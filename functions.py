# Week 1 Task 3 Part 1: Functions
# [YOURNAME]

# Video link: https://youtu.be/0ykzaQ4QFNU

# In the video, I explained an example of why to use a function in your code
# Now, after we've watched the video and understood why you need the function, 
# you need to do the following:

# TODO: Print 10 users' **name** and  **age**, and print if the user is **adult** or **underage**
# You can make up some random info, or friends. It does not matter. (Main Task - 3 tokens)


# TODO: Can you print all 10 users without repeating the function you created? (Subtask - 2 tokens)
# hint: `list` & `loop` 

# NOTE: The whole point of this task is to NOT repeat code (DRY). 
# You'll get evaluated based on that. Good luckðŸ˜¼
